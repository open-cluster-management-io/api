The canonical location of the Open Cluster Management API definition.

## Generating CRD for the first time

To generate a CRD for the first time, please follow the following steps:
1. Make sure you have `controller-gen` locally installed in `_output/tools/bin` directory. If not, you can use `make ensure-controller-gen` to build one.
2. Run `'_output/tools/bin/controller-gen' crd:preserveUnknownFields=false paths="<API_DIRECTORY>" output:dir="<API_DIRECTORY>"` to generate a CRD.
   - `API_DIRECTORY` is the location of your APIs. For example, addon APIs are in `./addon/v1alpha1` directory. You will need `doc.go` and `types.go` created in your `API_DIRECTORY`.
3. Rename the CRD to follow the naming convention `0000_0x_<GROUP>_<RESOURCE>.crd.yaml`. 
   - `0x` should be a monotonically increasing number for each CRD in the `API_DIRECTORY`, and should start from `00`. 
   - `GROUP` is the group of your API, and `RESOURCE` is the resource name. For example, ManagedCluster is using `0000_00_clusters.open-cluster-management.io_managedclusters.crd.yaml`.
4. Remove `metadata.annotations` in the generated CRD. The generated CRD will have an annotation of the generator's version equals to `(devel)` as showed below, and we can simply remove these two lines:
   ```
    annotations:
      controller-gen.kubebuilder.io/version: (devel)
   ```

## Updating CRD schemas

If you make a change to a CRD type in this repo, calling `make update-codegen-crds` should regenerate all CRDs and update the manifests. If yours is not updated, ensure that the path to its API is included in our [calls to the Makefile targets](https://github.com/openshift/api/blob/release-4.5/Makefile#L17-L29).

To add this generator to another repo:
1. Vendor `github.com/openshift/library-go` (and ensure that the `alpha-build-machinery` subdirectory is also included in your `vendor`)

2. Update your `Makefile` to include the following:
```
include $(addprefix ./vendor/github.com/openshift/library-go/alpha-build-machinery/make/, \
  targets/openshift/crd-schema-gen.mk \
)

$(call add-crd-gen,<TARGET_NAME>,<API_DIRECTORY>,<CRD_MANIFESTS>,<MANIFEST_OUTPUT>)
```
The parameters for the call are:

1. `TARGET_NAME`: The name of your generated Make target. This can be anything, as long as it does not conflict with another make target. Recommended to be your api name.
2. `API_DIRECTORY`: The location of your API. For example if your Go types are located under `pkg/apis/myoperator/v1/types.go`, this should be `./pkg/apis/myoperator/v1`.
3. `CRD_MANIFESTS`: The directory your CRDs are located in. For example, if that is `manifests/my_operator.crd.yaml` then it should be `./manifests`
4. `MANIFEST_OUTPUT`: This should most likely be the same as `CRD_MANIFESTS`, and is only provided for flexibility to output generated code to a different directory.

You can include as many calls to different APIs as necessary, or if you have multiple APIs under the same directory (eg, `v1` and `v2beta1`) you can use 1 call to the parent directory pointing to your API.

After this, calling `make update-codegen-crds` should generate a new structural OpenAPIV3 schema for your CRDs.

**Notes**

- This will not generate entire CRDs, only their OpenAPIV3 schemas. If you do not already have a CRD, you will get no output from the generator.
- Ensure that your API is correctly declared for the generator to pick it up. That means, in your `doc.go`, include the following:
  1. `// +groupName=<API_GROUP_NAME>`, this should match the `group` in your CRD `spec`
  2. `// +kubebuilder:validation:Optional`, this tells the operator that fields should be optional unless explicitly marked with `// +kubebuilder:validation:Required`
- This will not touch any non-schema fields in the CRD. For example, `additionalPrinterColumns` & `preserveUnknownFields`. To regenerate those fields, please follow the instructions in the [Generating CRD for the first time](#Generating-CRD-for-the-first-time) section.

For more information on the API markers to add to your Go types, see the [Kubebuilder book](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/markers.html)

## Generating code
To generate `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` & `zz_generated.swagger_doc_generated.go`:
1. You will need to create a `register.go` file in your `API_DIRECTORY`. You can get an example from [/cluster/v1/register.go](/cluster/v1/register.go). Make sure the `package`, `GroupName`, and `GroupVersion` are correct. Make sure the `addKnownTypes()` function adds types you are creating in `types.go`.
2. Add `add-crd-gen` in `Makefile` (step 2 of [Updating CRD schemas](#Updating-CRD-schemas)).
3. Run `make update-scripts` to see `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` & `zz_generated.swagger_doc_generated.go` generated in your API directory, and along with some related scripts generated in `client` directory. If `zz_generated.deepcopy.go` is not generated properly, please run the command in a container with `RUNTIME=docker make update-with-container` (if you are using `podman`, set `RUNTIME=podman`).

## Verify
Before you commit you changes, please run `make verify` locally to make sure you have generated all required files.
